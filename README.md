# Feature-Diagram
A sample feature diagram commonly used in Wallaroo Media's designs

The desktop features are placed absolutely requiring fine tuning based on the diagram.

This demo looks really messy and bad, but when replaced with the real assets, it ends up looking like the one on haybalancer.com

There are some styles set to manually move the p elements to align them properly with the feature images.
